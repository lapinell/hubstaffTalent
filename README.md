**UI:**
* Build a ReactJS application that builds the design exactly as shown in the screenshot at https://dribbble.com/shots/2935516-Job-search/attachments/609506 and connect it to the rest API that you just built, and enable searching based on all of the filters.
* Use ant.design ui components as opposed to bootstrap.
* Redux use is not necessary

**Evaluation is done on the basis of:**
* Use of tech
* Quality of code
* Design quality
* Implementation speed
* Data structure designed
* Functionality and how well it works.

## Tools

### Database
In order to complete this project, I have chosen to use:
* [Github's Jobs API](https://jobs.github.com/api) for a list of jobs
* [JSON-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) for any possible CRUD functionality (if needed)

_Note:_ I chose not to build in NodeJS because, at the moment, I do not know NodeJS - though am excited to learn this after I graduate.

### User Interface
For the user interface, I have chosen to use:
* [ReactJS]() as my framework
* [Ant.Design]() as my component library
* [SCSS]() as my css framework and compiler

_Note:_ Ant.Design is a new component library to me. Before I was using Bootstrap and Reactstrap as my component libraries. I also have not used SCSS with React before.
