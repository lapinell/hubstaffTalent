# Personal Job Portal

## About

This project started in June, 2018 as a hiring assessment turned final project for my front end design and development bootcamp. You can find more information about the history of this project [here](./History.md). 

Currently, this is a personal project to exercise my skills in UI development, API integration, and headless WordPress development. Please make sure to read the License and Terms of Service Agreement before forking and utilizing it yourself. I'll note here (and there) that some of the APIs used in this project can only be used in a personal manner and cannot be commercialized.

**PJP Capabilities**

These are the planned features of this application. My user is focused primarily on me. If you wish to suggest features, improvements, etc - please feel free to ping me.

* **Web-first, mobile-frienly** - it will be web first because that is where I primarily hunt for jobs
* **Search multiple job apis** - the idea is to cut down on the surfing and go to one place for everything
   * (Ideally) Search by 'date', 'rate type' (hourly, salaried), 'contract or w2', 'full-time or part-time', 'number of hours needed', etc (depends on what the APIs are offering), 'keywords' (i.g., reactjs, WordPress, etc)
* **Mark as 'Applied To', 'To Apply', and 'Interested'** - CRUD functionalit\\ required
* **Google authentication** - for multiple users using the same deployment
* **Cuts out obvious duplicate job postings** - because smart employers post the same posting everywhere


## Tools
